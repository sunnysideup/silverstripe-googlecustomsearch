Google Custom Search Module for SilverStripe
============================================
A simple extension to add a Google Custom Search to your SilverStripe template.

It allows you to add a search form to any page, which will give instant
ajaxified results within 200ms or so, as well as allowing the user
to go through to a more advanced search page.
